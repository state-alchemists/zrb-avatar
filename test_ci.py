"""The CI configuration is what keeps the model key out of a pull request's hands.

Read as a checklist, the way `test_face.py` is: five rules, each one careless edit
away from being untrue.

* a workflow that names a secret is not triggered by `pull_request`;
* no workflow checks out the pull request's head;
* every external action is pinned to a commit;
* every runner names an image rather than `-latest`;
* every workflow declares its own `permissions`.
